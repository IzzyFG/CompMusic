## Computational Music Projects

This repo is intended as a portfolio for my work in Barnard COMS 3430 Computational Music class class.

### [Lab 1: Build your own keyboard](./lab_1)

Created an web-interactive keyboard with JS, HTML, and CSS.

### [Lab 2: Build your own Synth](./lab_2)

This project is an expansion on [lab_1](./lab_1) in which we were tasked in building a simple keyboard. In this project we are expanding the complexity.

### [Lab 3: Farnell synthesis](./lab_3)

In our previous labs, we built a keyboard and synthesizer. Now we move to a different type of synthesis, looking at procedural sounds and audio effects.
