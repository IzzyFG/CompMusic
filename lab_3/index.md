## [Lab 3: Farnell synthesis](farnell)

In our previous labs, we built a keyboard and synthesizer. Now we move to a different type of synthesis, looking at procedural sounds and audio effects.

## TODO:

Write a short blog describing the sound you were aiming to recreate, and walking through the key parts of your code.

Include an image of the audio signal flow graph. This can be generated with the WebAudio visualizer Chrome extension (if it is working properly), or drawn by hand. (1 pt)

Explain your process and experience. What were the types of synthesis you use, how do they fit together, and why did you made these choices? (2 pts)
